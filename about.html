            Hello, I'm Michale Proffitt, a 16-year-old who goes to Warren Central where I am an incoming Junior. At
            school,
            I am involved in our nanoline and robotics teams. I am very into photography and music, both being very
            important to me. I am currently doing an internship at nextech for coding as well as working at Dairy Queen.
            My
            current plan is to hopefully graduate this upcoming school year and then go on to get a degree in software
            engineering, while I work an internship I was offered at the regional for the nanoline team I am a part of.
